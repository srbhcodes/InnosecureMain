                With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), ensuring security and privacy in AI systems has become a critical concern, as traditional AI models rely on centralized data collection, making them vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and privacy violations. To address these challenges, two advanced techniques—Federated Learning (FL) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE)—are being integrated to enhance AI security. Federated Learning is a decentralized approach that enables AI models to be trained across multiple devices or servers without transferring raw data, ensuring that user information remains on their device while only the updated model parameters are shared. This method enhances privacy, reduces latency, scales efficiently across millions of edge devices, and helps organizations comply with data regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. However, FL faces challenges such as communication overhead due to synchronizing updates across multiple devices and security vulnerabilities like model inversion and poisoning attacks. On the other hand, Homomorphic Encryption is an encryption technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring complete confidentiality during processing. HE comes in different forms, including Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), which supports either addition or multiplication; Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE), which allows a limited number of operations before requiring decryption; and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which enables unlimited computations but remains computationally expensive. The primary benefits of HE include safeguarding data privacy, enabling secure AI model training on encrypted data, and preventing unauthorized access even if data is intercepted. However, its computational complexity and the challenges of implementing FHE in real-world applications remain significant barriers. By integrating FL and HE, a robust AI security framework is created, as FL ensures data remains decentralized, reducing exposure risks, while HE ensures computations are performed securely, even when external servers process encrypted data. This powerful combination enhances AI security in sensitive fields such as healthcare, where encrypted patient data can be used to train AI models across multiple hospitals without compromising privacy; finance, where banks can collaboratively train fraud detection models without exposing customer data; and IoT and edge AI, where smart devices can securely process information without transmitting raw data to cloud servers. As AI security threats continue to evolve, Federated Learning and Homomorphic Encryption will play a crucial role in developing secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving AI systems. With ongoing advancements in computing power and cryptographic techniques, these methods are expected to become more efficient and widely adopted, making next-generation AI security a reality.
